No alarms (overcharge, terminate charge, overtemperature, remaining capacity, remaining time, terminate discharge) are active. No errors are detected (error code 0x0).

  "0x02D0": "Based on the provided bitfield summary, here is the operational conclusion:\n\n**Operational Status:**\n\n*   **No Critical Alarms:** All critical alarm bits (OCA, TCA, OTA, TDA, RTA) are cleared (0), indicating no immediate safety or termination issues related to charge/discharge, temperature, or remaining time.\n*   **Device Initializing:** The `INIT` bit is set (1), indicating the device is likely in an initialization or startup phase.\n*   **Battery Status:** The battery is currently **discharging** or in a **relaxation state** (`DSG` = 1). It is **not** fully charged (`FC` = 0). Crucially, the **fully discharged** (`FD`) bit is set (1), suggesting the battery is considered at its lowest operational state.\n*   **Remaining Capacity Alert:** A **Remaining Capacity Alarm** (`RCA` = 1) is active, indicating the battery's available capacity may be critically low or below a threshold.\n*   **No Errors:** No specific error code is indicated (Bits 3-0 = 0x0).\n\n**Summary:** The device is initializing, and while no critical alarms are active, the battery is in a discharged state (`FD` set) and a remaining capacity alarm is triggered (`RCA` set). The battery is not fully charged (`FC` = 0) but is discharging (`DSG` = 1). This indicates a potentially low battery level during initialization.",
