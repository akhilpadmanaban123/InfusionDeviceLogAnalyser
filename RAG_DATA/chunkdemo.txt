 give an idea about how the chunk should be:

So chunk#1 should have : 
    - ChunkID   : #CreateUniqueChunkID
    - StartDate : 06/17/2025
    - StartTime : 08:49:11
    - StartStates:
        - BattPres : No Battery
        - PowerSrc : AC
        - Perc : [0,0,0,.....]  # here the percentage list is updated from each timeline starting from 08:49:11 until the chunk ends
        - Similarly all these can be added here as a list until the chunk ends 
    - EndDate: 06/17/2025
    - EndTime: 09:38:23
    - TotalTime : #calculate and add the timeframe in the form of DD:HH:MM:SS
